            <h2>My Journey in Photo Editing and Playing Instruments</h2>
           <p>
            My artistic journey began at the age of 16, initially sparked by an intrigue in photo editing and later, a fascination with music production. Both disciplines started with simple tools—basic editing software for photos and introductory music production programs. I learned to manipulate visuals and sounds, adjusting colors and pitches, applying filters, and layering tracks.            </p>
            <p>
                As I dived deeper, I found a common theme: a passion for transforming the mundane into the extraordinary. In photo editing, this meant enhancing the colors of a sunset or retouching a portrait to capture a subject’s essence. In music, it involved enriching the harmonies of a melody or fine-tuning the dynamics of a composition to evoke specific emotions. These hobbies quickly turned into a deep-seated passion as I spent countless hours honing my skills, exploring advanced techniques, and undertaking more complex projects.            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, I've utilized a range of tools from Adobe Photoshop to GIMP in photo editing, and from Ableton Live to FL Studio in music production. Each tool offered unique features that expanded my creative possibilities. My journey has been about more than mastering these tools—it’s been about understanding the art of storytelling, whether through visual or auditory means.            </p>
            <p> Here is one recent project that captures my dual interests. I revisited a photo I took two years ago at the University of Idaho, applying advanced editing techniques I’ve learned over the years. This image not only reflects my growth in photo editing but also parallels my journey in music production, where each layer and adjustment adds depth and emotion, much like the complex arrangements in my musical compositions.            </p>
